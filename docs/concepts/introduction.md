When considering cross-chain strategies, many products rely on zap systems, bridge funds, and relayers to execute desired actions. Nimbora stands out by aggregating these intents into pools, batching them to accommodate multiple users, and executing transactions efficiently. This approach enables a single transaction to execute multiple L2 transactions, drastically reducing gas costs. Nimbora abstracts these complexities for users, allowing seamless and gasless utilization of L1 strategies from L2. With Nimbora, accessing and utilizing cross-chain strategies becomes effortless.
