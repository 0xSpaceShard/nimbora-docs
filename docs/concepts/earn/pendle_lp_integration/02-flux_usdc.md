**Pendle LP stratgy, earn with USDC** 

FUSDC is an interest-bearing token received when depositing USDC into Flux Finance's lending pools. FUSDC represents a user's deposited USDC plus accrued interest. Users earn interest on their deposited USDC in the form of FUSDC, which grows over time based on the interest rate offered by the lending pool.




### What is FLUX

  - Decentralized Lending and Borrowing: Flux Protocol, developed by the Ondo Finance team, facilitates decentralized lending and borrowing. It allows users to lend their assets to earn interest or borrow assets against collateral in a peer-to-pool (P2Pool) model.
  - Support for Permissionless and Permissioned Tokens: Flux Protocol supports both permissionless tokens (e.g., USDC) and permissioned tokens (e.g., OUSG), with permissions enforced on a per-asset basis. This flexibility accommodates various token types and use cases within the protocol.
