**Pendle LP stratgy, earn with USDT** 

aUSDT is an interest-bearing token received when depositing USDT (Tether) into Aave's lending pools. It represents a user's deposited USDT plus accrued interest. Users earn interest on their deposited USDT in the form of aUSDT, which grows over time based on the interest rate offered by the lending pool.


### What is AAVE

  - Decentralized Lending and Borrowing Platform: AAVE is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks. It enables individuals to earn interest on deposited assets or borrow assets by providing collateral.
  - Interest Rates and Algorithmic Adjustments: AAVE employs an innovative interest rate model that adjusts borrowing rates dynamically based on supply and demand dynamics within the protocol. This helps to ensure competitive and efficient utilization of assets while maintaining stability.
