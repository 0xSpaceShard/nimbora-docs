# Nimbora Overview

Nimbora is a 1-click DeFi pooling product, incubated by the [SpaceShard team](https://www.spaceshard.io/).

It is a platform that offers you the opportunity to interact with your favorite Layer 1 (L1) protocols at a fraction of the cost of Layer 2 (L2) solutions. The idea behind it is to scale L1 DeFi through seamless L2 execution, all while maintaining super-low fees. The technology behind Nimbora is Zero-Knowledge Rollups, currently Starknet - a permissionless decentralized ZK-Rollup that operates as an L2 network over Ethereum. To put it simply, Nimbora scales L1 DeFi products completely trustlessly using rollups.

## What wallets can I connect with?

At the moment, Nimbora supports compatibility with [Argent X wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/) and [Braavos wallet](https://braavos.app/). Argent X is a smart wallet designed to provide a simple and secure way to manage and invest digital assets. On the other hand, Braavos wallet is a decentralized wallet known for its user-friendly interface and high-level security features. The integration of these wallets with Nimbora allows users to conveniently interact with preferred Layer 1 protocols at a significantly reduced cost. Nimbora is committed to enhancing user experience and thus, plans to integrate more wallets in the near future.
