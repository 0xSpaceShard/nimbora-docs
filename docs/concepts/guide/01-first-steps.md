## Getting Started on Starknet

The first step consists of installing Starknet wallets and bridging funds to your account. The entire setup process is explained in detail [here](https://www.starknet.io/en/content/getting-started-using-starknet-setting-up-a-starknet-wallet).


## Connect to Nimbora

The process begins by visiting the Nimbora platform at https://app.nimbora.io/

Click “**Connect Wallet**” in the top right corner

For the sake of this tutorial we will be using **Argent X** wallet extension.

### This enable Nimbora to:

- Read your wallet address
- Request transactions

*You will still need to sign any new transaction*

Voila! “**Connect wallet**”  will be replaced with your wallet address, indicating you are successfully connected.
