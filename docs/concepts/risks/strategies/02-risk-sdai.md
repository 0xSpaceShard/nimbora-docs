# Understanding Risks Associated with SDAI

## Exploit Risk (General DeFi Risk):
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: sDAI, like other DeFi protocols, is susceptible to exploits, including smart contract vulnerabilities and malicious attacks.


## Regulatory Risks:
- **Decentralized Nature**: MakerDAO's shift towards RWA-based collateral introduces regulatory uncertainty due to its decentralized nature.
- **Compliance Challenges**: Increased reliance on RWAs may lead to compliance challenges and potential regulatory gaps.

## Collateral Risks:
- **Default Risks**: RWAs' default risks may result in collateral shortfalls, jeopardizing the 1:1 USD peg of sDAI.
- **Liquidity Strains**: Fluctuations in the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) could strain liquidity buffers if significant amounts of sDAI are minted or burned abruptly.
- **Duration Risk**: RWAs' sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations may lead to losses if redemptions are required before maturity.

## Counterparty Risk:
- **Credit Risks**: MakerDAO's engagement with multiple counterparties exposes it to credit risks such as liquidity, reputation, and settlement challenges.

## Centralization and Transparency Risks:
- **Increased Centralization**: Pursuing additional returns through RWAs may increase centralization within MakerDAO.
- **Transparency Challenges**: Onboarding RWAs reduces transparency compared to on-chain crypto assets, posing transparency risks.
