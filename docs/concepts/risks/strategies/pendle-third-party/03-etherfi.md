# Understanding Risks Associated with EtherFi

When engaging with EtherFi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, it's essential to be aware of the potential risks involved. Here are some key risks to consider:

1. **Smart Contract Risks**:
   - Though EtherFi's smart contracts are crafted carefully, audited, and thoroughly tested, there always exist risks in interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

2. **Key Management Risks**:
   - With EtherFi's desktop and decentralized web applications, efforts are made to utilize the latest, safest methods for key encryption and protection. However, EtherFi cannot guarantee or represent that their methods are or will remain 100% secure. Additionally, the responsibility for key management lies in the hands of the user, and preventing user errors, while a primary aim, is virtually impossible.

3. **Regulatory Risks**:
   - EtherFi believes in the potential of the Ethereum network to become the settlement layer for global financial markets. However, this conviction does not guarantee the future. Cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, have faced increased governmental scrutiny as they transition from niche to mainstream. Regulatory risks include, but are not limited to:
     - Bans on cloud service providers offering services to crypto-related enterprises.
     - Bans on ISPs providing crypto-related services.
     - Onerous taxes levied on various network transactions.
