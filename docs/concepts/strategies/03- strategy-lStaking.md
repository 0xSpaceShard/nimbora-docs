# How does liquid straking works

<details>
  <summary>What is stETH</summary>

    [stETH Docs](https://docs.lido.fi/#liquid-staking)

    - stETH represents a token you receive when you stake Ethereum (ETH) through the Lido platform, allowing you to earn staking rewards while keeping your assets liquid.

    - It mirrors the value of your staked ETH plus accrued staking rewards, enabling its use in various DeFi applications without locking your assets.

    - stETH can be traded, used as collateral for loans, or utilized in yield farming, providing flexibility and liquidity not available with traditional ETH staking.

  <summary>What is Lido</summary>

    [Lido Docs](https://docs.lido.fi/#what-is-lido)

    - Lido enables earning on digital tokens with liquidity maintained for DeFi application use, through network-specific staking pools.
    
    - It offers st[token]s for flexible transfer and use in DeFi, diverging from traditional locked staking.

    - Lido is governed by a DAO, which is responsible for managing protocol parameters and selecting node operators.

    - Primarily focusing on Ethereum, Lido's governance is implemented through the ERC20 LDO token, with st[token]s representing users' staked assets and accumulated rewards.
