**This startegy provides an opportunity for users to take advantage of their ETH assets** by staking them to a Liquid Staking vault. Through this depositing process, users can put their ETH to work, receive wstETH in exchange and potentially generate profits as time progresses. This strategy merges the stability of ETH with the income-generating capacity of LIDO.

### What is wstETH

    - wstETH represents a token you receive when you stake Ethereum (ETH) through the Lido platform, allowing you to earn staking rewards while keeping your assets liquid.

    - It mirrors the value of your staked ETH plus accrued staking rewards, enabling its use in various DeFi applications without locking your assets.

    - wstETH can be traded, used as collateral for loans, or utilized in yield farming, providing flexibility and liquidity not available with traditional ETH staking.

### What is Lido

    - Lido enables earning on digital tokens with liquidity maintained for DeFi application use, through network-specific staking pools.
    
    - It offers st[token]s for flexible transfer and use in DeFi, diverging from traditional locked staking.

    - Lido is governed by a DAO, which is responsible for managing protocol parameters and selecting node operators.

    - Primarily focusing on Ethereum, Lido's governance is implemented through the ERC20 LDO token, with st[token]s representing users' staked assets and accumulated rewards.

## How to deposit

To get started with the Liquid Staking strategy, your first step is to establish a connection with Nimbora. This connection can be facilitated through supported wallets, such as Argent or Braavos. Make sure you have a balance of ETH tokens in your chosen wallet.

Once you're connected to Nimbora, locate and choose the Liquid Staking strategy. This will show you key metrics such as Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and Total Value Locked (TVL). Also, there will be an option to input the kind and quantity of tokens you wish to contribute to the Liquid Staking strategy. The resulting quantity of wstETH tokens you're expected to receive upon completion of the transaction will be displayed.

The quantity of wstETH tokens you accumulate could fluctuate based on the specific asset you contribute. While depositing the primary token, ETH, is always an option, other tokens can also be deposited by some users. In such instances, Nimbora will convert the deposited token into the primary asset, ETH.

Once you've chosen the token type and quantity for deposit, press the "deposit" button and adhere to the steps provided by your wallet (Argent or Braavos) to finalize the transaction.

## How to request a withdrawal

If you've been participating in the Liquid Staking strategy and wish to retrieve your assets, it's entirely possible. However, it's crucial to understand that Nimbora can't handle the withdrawal request for you. You'll need to carry out the process yourself, but rest assured, it's straightforward.

The first step is determining the amount you want to reclaim. This could be the total or a part of your assets. After deciding, find and select the 'withdraw' option.

Upon selecting 'withdraw', your Wallet will direct you through the subsequent stages. Simply adhere to the instructions therein to finalize the transaction.

Please note, the assets you retrieve won't be in the same form as when you deposited them. You'll receive them as ETH, the fundamental asset used in the Liquid Staking strategy. This implies that regardless of the type of asset you initially deposited, you'll always receive ETH upon withdrawal.

## How to claim a withdrawal

After you've requested to withdraw your assets, the responsibility for processing this request shifts to Nimbora. This process entails prepping your assets for transfer back to your Wallet, all of which is managed behind-the-scenes by Nimbora to ensure seamless and efficient operation.

Think of this process as preparing a package for shipping. Nimbora handles the packaging of your assets and readies them for return to you, the owner. During this stage, you can sit back and relax - Nimbora takes over all the technical intricacies involved.

Upon completion of the asset processing and preparation phase, a 'claim' button will appear on your screen. This button signals the final stage of the withdrawal process, indicating that your assets are ready for claiming.

The 'claim' button serves as a notification that your package (in this case, your assets) has reached its final destination and is ready for collection. Once you see the 'claim' button, just click on it to receive your ETH tokens. This action concludes the withdrawal process.
