    - MakerDAO aims to stabilize the crypto economy using a dual-token system: Dai for stability and MKR for governance, emphasizing the necessity of a decentralized stablecoin for digital financial benefits.

    - It champions decentralized finance (DeFi) accessibility, striving for economic empowerment and equal access to the global financial market for all.

    - The Multi Collateral Dai (MCD) update expands collateral options to include various Ethereum-based assets, contingent on approval by MKR holders.
