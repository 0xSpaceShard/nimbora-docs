# Understanding Risks Associated with SDAI

## Exploit Risk (General DeFi Risk):[](https://docs-test.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/risks/strategies/sdai#exploit-risk-general-defi-risk)

- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: sDAI, like other DeFi protocols, is susceptible to exploits, including smart contract vulnerabilities and malicious attacks.

## Regulatory Risks:[](https://docs-test.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/risks/strategies/sdai#regulatory-risks)

- **Decentralized Nature**: MakerDAO's shift towards RWA-based collateral introduces regulatory uncertainty due to its decentralized nature.
- **Compliance Challenges**: Increased reliance on RWAs may lead to compliance challenges and potential regulatory gaps.

## Collateral Risks:[](https://docs-test.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/risks/strategies/sdai#collateral-risks)

- **Default Risks**: RWAs' default risks may result in collateral shortfalls, jeopardizing the 1:1 USD peg of sDAI.
- **Liquidity Strains**: Fluctuations in the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) could strain liquidity buffers if significant amounts of sDAI are minted or burned abruptly.
- **Duration Risk**: RWAs' sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations may lead to losses if redemptions are required before maturity.

## Counterparty Risk:[](https://docs-test.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/risks/strategies/sdai#counterparty-risk)

- **Credit Risks**: MakerDAO's engagement with multiple counterparties exposes it to credit risks such as liquidity, reputation, and settlement challenges.

## Centralization and Transparency Risks:[](https://docs-test.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/risks/strategies/sdai#centralization-and-transparency-risks)

- **Increased Centralization**: Pursuing additional returns through RWAs may increase centralization within MakerDAO.
- **Transparency Challenges**: Onboarding RWAs reduces transparency compared to on-chain crypto assets, posing transparency risks.
