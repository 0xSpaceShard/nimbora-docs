## What is sSTRK

sSTRK (staked STRK) is a liquid staking token (LST) representing STRK staked with Nimbora.

When you [stake your STRK tokens on Nimbora](https://app.nimbora.io/stake/), you receive sSTRK in return. The sSTRK token reflects your staked position on Nimbora and acts as a claim on your original STRK.

The beauty of all LST tokens lies in their **liquidity -** unlike traditional staking, where tokens are locked up, LST will enable users to keep their staked assets liquid and transferable. This means that you will be able to continue to participate in other DeFi activities while your STRK tokens are still earning rewards.

## Get Started

Visit [Nimbora dApp](https://app.nimbora.io/stake/) and connect your Starknet wallet ([Braavos](https://braavos.app/) or [ArgentX](https://argent.xyz/)).

![alt](../../../../static/content/stake_strk/get%20started.png)

Enter the amount of STRK you want to deposit, or click on the small buttons below the box (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) to set a desired percentage of the balance you want to deposit.

Stack multiple benefits:

You can earn from staking, trading fees, lending, and protocol incentives, all while maintaining flexibility to switch between different strategies as market conditions change.

## How to unstake

You can choose between two options - Instant and Normal.

Instant mode factors in the price impact and set slippage.

Normal unstake duration is 21 days.

![alt](../../../../static/content/stake_strk/normal.png)

Once you have selected the prefered method, you will need to decide on the amount you want to withdraw.  This could be all or a portion of your assets.

![alt](../../../../static/content/stake_strk/normal%20amount.png)

Click on the 'unstake' button and follow the prompts on your wallet ([Braavos](https://braavos.app/) or [ArgentX](https://argent.xyz/)) to complete the transaction.

![alt](../../../../static/content/stake_strk/unstake_wallet.png)

Once the transaction has been accepted on the network, a popup will appear at the bottom right of the screen to let you know.

![alt](../../../../static/content/stake_strk/unstake_confirm.png)

You can consult all of your recent transactions in the wallet section. Your transaction should be here.

![alt](../../../../static/content/stake_strk/unstake_modal.png) 

And that's it, you should see your pending request in the navbar.

![alt](../../../../static/content/stake_strk/unstake_pending.png)

Nimbora takes over the task of processing this request. This involves preparing your assets in order to be transferred back to your wallet, a process that is handled entirely behind the scenes to ensure a smooth and efficient operation. Once the request is ready to be claimed, Nimbora relayer will handle it and send it directly into your wallet.
