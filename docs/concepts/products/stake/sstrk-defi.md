### 5. Opus

Deposit sSTRK on Opus to borrow $CASH. 

➡️ https://app.opus.money/troves/open

![alt](../../../../static/content/stake_strk/opus.png)

It lets you borrow against a portfolio of carefully curated collateral including yield-bearing assets. With minimal human intervention, the interest rates, maximum loan-to-value ratios and liquidation thresholds are dynamically determined by each user's collateral profile.

The asset you are borrowing is CASH, an algorithmic overcollateralized stablecoin soft pegged to the US dollar.

**How is CASH different from other stablecoins?**

Opus introduces novel mechanisms that provide stronger stability guarantees to ensure that CASH is pegged to the value of USD.

1. A global [multiplier](https://docs.opus.money/current/peg-stability#how-does-the-multiplier-work) is applied to increase or decrease interest rates across the board, depending on whether the spot market price of CASH is below or above peg.
2. A [forge fee](https://docs.opus.money/current/peg-stability#how-do-forge-fees-work) is charged on minting of new debt when the spot market price of CASH is below peg.

 **What are Solvers?**

Solvers are a new, improved framework for building Haiko Vaults. They take the best parts of Strategies (i.e. convenience, 1-click automation) and make them simpler, more powerful, and less error-prone.

Solver Vaults introduce new features such as:

- **Zero cost rebalancing:** rebuilt from the ground up with a new architecture, Solvers are now stateless and can be rebalanced without any on-chain position updates, at zero gas cost to both swappers and LPs
- **Impermanent Loss caps**: pools can apply a hard cap on impermanent loss by rejecting swaps that bring the pool above its maximum allowed level portfolio skew
