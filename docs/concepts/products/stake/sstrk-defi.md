## What can you do with your sSTRK?

### 1. Provide Liquidity on Ekubo

Put your sSTRK to work in Ekubo’s liquidity pools, by providing liquidity to the sSTRK/STRK pool 👇

- 2x Nimbora tokens for being a liquidity provider
- Continue earning standard staking rewards

### 2. Lending on Vesu

Stack multiple benefits:

- Earn lending APR
- Receive double Nimbora points
- Support Starknet’s lending markets

You can earn from staking, trading fees, lending, and protocol incentives, all while maintaining flexibility to switch between different strategies as market conditions change. This means you can stack multiple reward streams on top of your base staking position, optimizing your yields based on market opportunities.
