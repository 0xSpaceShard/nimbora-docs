**Pendle LP stratgy, earn with ETH** 

Liquid restaking on Ethereum repurposes staked ether to validate external systems like rollups or oracles, enhancing the ecosystem's security. Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) act as a buffer against slashing events and offer higher yields than native staking. They simplify participation, manage risks, and conserve gas by batch-collecting rewards. This innovation democratizes staking, challenging established leaders, and offers growth potential, albeit with capped deposits in some systems. Overall, it diversifies Ethereum's staking landscape while bolstering its security and efficiency.



weETH is the wrapped version of eETH, the etherfi native token, which serves as a liquid staking derivative token. eETH streamlines the staking process by enabling automatic restaking and offering various benefits to users. This includes rewards from both EtherFi and EigenLayer, simplifying the staking experience and providing additional incentives for participation in the DeFi ecosystem. 

Yield come from several sources: 
  - Ethereum execution and consensus layer staking rewards  
  - loyalty points 
  - EigenLayer restaking rewards





### What is EtherFI


  - Non-Custodial Staking: EtherFi disrupts the decentralized finance (DeFi) space by offering non-custodial Ethereum staking. Users maintain full control over their keys, ensuring security and independence in the staking process. This approach contrasts with traditional custodial services where users relinquish control of their assets to third-party entities.
  - Integration with EigenLayer for Enhanced Yields: EtherFi collaborates with EigenLayer, a protocol that increases rewards and boosts the value of DeFi by supporting simpler restaking. Through this integration, users can earn additional yields on top of Ethereum's staking rewards without locking up their assets, promoting flexibility and maximizing earning potential.
  

### Understanding Risks Associated with EtherFi

1. **Smart Contract Risks**:
   - Though EtherFi's smart contracts are crafted carefully, audited, and thoroughly tested, there always exist risks in interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

2. **Key Management Risks**:
   - With EtherFi's desktop and decentralized web applications, efforts are made to utilize the latest, safest methods for key encryption and protection. However, EtherFi cannot guarantee or represent that their methods are or will remain 100% secure. Additionally, the responsibility for key management lies in the hands of the user, and preventing user errors, while a primary aim, is virtually impossible.

3. **Regulatory Risks**:
   - EtherFi believes in the potential of the Ethereum network to become the settlement layer for global financial markets. However, this conviction does not guarantee the future. Cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, have faced increased governmental scrutiny as they transition from niche to mainstream. Regulatory risks include, but are not limited to:
     - Bans on cloud service providers offering services to crypto-related enterprises.
     - Bans on ISPs providing crypto-related services.
     - Onerous taxes levied on various network transactions.
