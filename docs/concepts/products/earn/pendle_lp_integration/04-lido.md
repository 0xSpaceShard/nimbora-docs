**Pendle LP strategy, earn with wstETH** 

Lido's stETH is a token representing your share of staked ETH. When you hold stETH, you will earn daily staking rewards through a supply rebase. You will earn additional yields coming from wsteth yield trading fees and auto-compound from $PENDLE liqudity mining.


## Get Started[](https://docs.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/products/earn/pendle_lp_integration/wstETH#get-started)

Visit Nimbora dApp via invite link and connect your Starknet wallet ([Braavos](https://braavos.app/) or [ArgentX](https://argent.xyz/)).

Enter the amount of wstETH you want to deposit, or click on the small buttons below the box (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) to set a desired percentage of the balance you want to deposit.

As a result, you will receive npstETH. And that's it, you should be able to see your balance of Nimbora Yield Token in the portfolio section or directly into your wallet browser.


## Your Earning Starts Immediately![](https://docs.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/products/earn/pendle_lp_integration/wstETH#your-earning-starts-immediately)

Your yield comes from several sources -  **npstETH base yield** + **$STRK** **incentives** + **Nimbora** **boost.**

![Untitled](../../../../../static/content/strategy_wstETH/main.png)


1. **Base**: Represents default strategy yield that auto-compounds daily. 
2. **Boost**: Represents incentives provided by the Nimbora team using the [Starknet Catalyst grant](https://medium.com/@Nimbora/nimbora-and-starknet-catalyst-program-14cc7f2f1ab5) that are claimable every week at the [rewards page](https://app.nimbora.io/rewards/).
3. **Incentives**: Represents incentives provided by the Starknet Foundation as a part of the [DeFi Spring 2.0](https://medium.com/@Nimbora/introducing-defi-spring-2-0-bigger-bolder-better-364bb96b02d6) that are claimable every week at the [rewards page](https://app.nimbora.io/rewards/).
4. **Extra: Ekubo LP** Providing Nimbora yield bearing tokens as liquidity on Ekubo is tracked and added to the total claimable STRK amount at the [rewards page](https://app.nimbora.io/rewards/).

With this strategy you are also earning Nimbora points. 
Remember, holding Nimbora yield-bearing tokens gets points based on your balance. The more and longer you hold, the more points you accumulate.

You can always check your leaderboard position and Nimbora points breakdown by clicking on ‘Points’ section in the upper left corner at app.nimbora.io

## How to Withdraw[](https://docs.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/products/earn/pendle_lp_integration/wstETH#how-to-withdraw)

You can choose between two withdrawal options - Instant and Normal.

![Untitled](../../../../../static/content/strategy_wstETH/withdraw.png)


Instant withdrawals factor in the price impact and set slippage. 

![Untitled](../../../../../static/content/strategy_wstETH/withdraw_normal.png)


Normal withdrawals are not synchronous such as deposits and take between 12 and 48 hours to be processed.

Once you have selected the withdraw tab, you will need to decide on the amount you want to withdraw. This could be all or a portion of your assets.

Click on the 'withdraw' button and follow the prompts on your wallet ([Braavos](https://braavos.app/) or [ArgentX](https://argent.xyz/)) to complete the transaction.

![Untitled](../../../../../static/content/strategy_wstETH/withdraw_confirm.png)

Once the transaction has been accepted on the network, a popup will appear at the bottom right of the screen to let you know.

![Untitled](../../../../../static/content/strategy_wstETH/withdraw_accept.png)


You can consult all of your recent transactions in the wallet section. Your transaction should be here.

## What is Lido

Lido is a liquid staking protocol backed by industry-leading staking providers that supports staking for Ethereum and Polygon. Lido lets users stake their tokens - without locking tokens or maintaining infrastructure - whilst participating in on-chain activities, e.g. lending, farming and more.

### What is stETH 

stETH is a transferable rebasing utility token representing a share of the total ETH staked through the protocol, which consists of user deposits and staking rewards. Because stETH rebases daily, it communicates the position of the share daily.


### What is wstETH

wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH. Wrapping stETH creates a DeFi-compatible version of the stETH token which allows for easier integrations with DeFi protocols including Uniswap and MakerDao.   


## Risks of staking with Lido
The Lido DAO is driven to mitigate above risks to the extent possible. Despite this, a number of potential risks still exist when staking ETH using Lido:

1. **Smart contract security**

  - There is an inherent risk that Lido Protocol could contain a smart contract vulnerability or bug. The Lido code is open-sourced, audited and covered by an extensive bug bounty program to minimise this risk.

2. **Technical risk**

  - Lido Protocol is built atop experimental technology under active development, and there is no guarantee that ETH has been developed error-free. Any vulnerabilities inherent to ETH brings with it slashing risk, as well as stETH fluctuation risk.

3. **Adoption risk**

  - The value of stETH is built around the staking rewards associated with the Ethereum beacon chain. If ETH fails to reach required levels of adoption we could experience significant fluctuations in the value of ETH and stETH.

4. **Slashing risk**

  - ETH validators risk staking penalties, with up to 100% of staked funds at risk if validators fail. To minimise this risk, Lido Protocol stakes across multiple professional and reputable node operators with heterogeneous setups, with additional mitigation in the form of insurance that is paid from Lido Protocol fees.

5. **stETH price risk**

Users risk an exchange price of stTokens which is lower than inherent value due to withdrawal restrictions on Lido, making arbitrage and risk-free market-making impossible. The Lido DAO is driven to mitigate the above risks and eliminate them entirely to the extent possible. Despite this, they may still exist and, as such, it is our duty to communicate them.
