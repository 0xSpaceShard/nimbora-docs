# **Introducing the Savings STRK (sSTRK) Vault**
![Nimbora sSTRK vault](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/sstrk%20vault.png)

You've asked, and we've delivered!

We're thrilled to announce the launch of the $sSTRK Vault, designed to maximize returns on $STRK for the entire Starknet ecosystem! 🐺

## **What is sSTRK?**
![What is STRK?](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/what%20is%20strk.png)


sSTRK stands for “Savings STRK,” similar to Spark’s sDAI (Savings DAI). 

The sSTRK vault is designed specifically for the Starknet ecosystem, providing a secure and efficient way to maximize the value of your STRK holdings. 


### **sSTRK Vault - How it Works**
![How it Works](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/how%20it%20works.png)


Savings STRK Vault is an advanced yield aggregator pool that allows users to deposit STRK and get the best possible returns.

The sSTRK vault comes with full modular contract and will have enhanced functionalities with each release: 

### Stage 0 - The Genesis
![The Genesis](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/the%20genesis.png)

We’re launching the genesis vault, and it will serve as the foundation for more advanced strategies in the future.
![sSTRK Vault](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/vault.png)

By depositing your STRK tokens into the vault, you will earn yield and accumulate Nimbora points at 2x rate and grow your position within the Nimbora ecosystem. 


We will funnel a part of the incentives to the sSTRK vault to enable yield for our users. This ensures that you continue to benefit from holding sSTRK while earning steady returns.

We are the recipient of the [Starknet Catalyst grant](https://medium.com/@Nimbora/nimbora-and-starknet-catalyst-program-14cc7f2f1ab5) and some of our vaults are receiving incentives from the Starknet Foundation as a part of the [DeFi Spring 2.0](https://medium.com/@Nimbora/introducing-defi-spring-2-0-bigger-bolder-better-364bb96b02d6)


### Stage 1 - Multiple Indexed Strategies
![Multiple Indexed Startegies](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/multiple%20indexed%20strategies.png)

When users deposit their STRK into the Savings STRK vault, the system actively employs advanced DeFi strategies to generate potential profits over time, optimizing their earning potential through automated and strategic investments.


![alt](/content/strategy_sstrk/overview.png)


This strategy combines multiple steps: 
- Underlaying asset is deposited in the main vault.
- The amount deposited is split into the different strategies respecting the debt allocation provided by the debt manager.
- Profits generated are periodically compounded and debt is reallocated dynamically following market conditions
- Rewards from [DeFi Spring 2.0](https://medium.com/@Nimbora/introducing-defi-spring-2-0-bigger-bolder-better-364bb96b02d6) are automatically claimed and vested over a week into the strategy

The unique strategies could come from: 
- Pure Lending
- DeFi Pooling
- Liquidity provision in meta-stable pools
- Liquidity provision in option pools
- Staking

We plan to bring additional utility to the sSTRK vault by enabling users to stake, restake and borrow assets against their sSTRK and interact with our live strategies such as the [nsDAI](https://docs.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/products/earn/nsDAI) or [npeETH](https://docs.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/products/earn/pendle_lp_integration/npeETH) strategy.

## As an example we’ll use the connecting sSTRK with npeETH strategy

Our [npeETH strategy](https://docs.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/products/earn/pendle_lp_integration/npeETH) is designed to maximize your returns. By participating in this strategy, you not only earn additional yield, but also farm 3x Etherfi points, 1x EigenLayer points, and 1x Nimbora points. This multifaceted reward system ensures that your investments are continuously working hard for you, providing both immediate and long-term benefits.

![npeETH Strategy](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/npeeth.png)


In this scenario, you would be earning yields from both the sSTRK vault and npeETH strategy, as well as 3x Etherfi points, 3x Nimbora points and 1x EigenLayer points.


## TL;DR of the Upgraded sSTRK Vault

1. **Automated Yield Generation**: Vaults optimize yield farming by shifting capital between different DeFi protocols.
2. **Passive Investment Strategy**: Vaults automate complex processes, allowing users without deep DeFi knowledge to earn returns.
3. **Dynamic Rebalancing**: The system continually adjusts to maximize profits as market conditions change.
4. **Modular Architecture**: Simplifies strategy creation and maintenance, encouraging innovation and reducing error rates.
5. **ERC-4626 Compatibility**: Ensures easy integration with other DeFi projects.
6. **Share Locking**: Prevent Sandwich attack on the vault when claiming $STRK coming from DeFi Spring.
