# **Introducing the sSTRK Vault**
![Nimbora sSTRK vault](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/sstrk%20vault.png)

## **What is sSTRK?**
![What is STRK?](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/what%20is%20strk.png)


sSTRK stands for “Savings STRK,” similar to Spark’s sDAI (Savings DAI). 

The sSTRK vault is designed specifically for the Starknet ecosystem, providing a secure and efficient way to maximize the value of your STRK holdings. We’re launching the genesis vault, and it will serve as the foundation for more advanced strategies in the future.

### **sSTRK Vault - How it Works**
![How it Works](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/how%20it%20works.png)


The sSTRK vault is the starting point for our innovative yield strategies. 

The sSTRK vault comes with upgradable contract and will have enhanced functionalities with each release: 

### Stage 0 - The Genesis
![The Genesis](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/the%20genesis.png)


By depositing your STRK tokens into the vault, you will accumulate Nimbora points at 2x rate and grow your position within the Nimbora ecosystem.

### Stage 1 - Simple Yield Strategy
![Simple Yield Strategy](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/simple%20yield%20strategy.png)


We will funnel a part of the incentives to the sSTRK vault to enable yield for our users. This ensures that you continue to benefit from holding sSTRK while earning steady returns.

We are the recipient of the [Starknet Catalyst grant](https://medium.com/@Nimbora/nimbora-and-starknet-catalyst-program-14cc7f2f1ab5) and some of our vaults are receiving incentives from the Starknet Foundation as a part of the [DeFi Spring 2.0](https://medium.com/@Nimbora/introducing-defi-spring-2-0-bigger-bolder-better-364bb96b02d6)

### Stage 2 - Multiple Indexed Strategies
![Multiple Indexed Startegies](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/multiple%20indexed%20strategies.png)


With our sSTRK vault, you are earning 2x [Nimbora points](https://docs.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/guide/points).  

![sSTRK Vault](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/vault.png)



We plan to bring additional utility to the sSTRK vault by enabling users to stake, restake and borrow assets against their sSTRK and interact with our live strategies such as the [nsDAI](https://docs.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/products/earn/nsDAI) or [npeETH](https://docs.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/products/earn/pendle_lp_integration/npeETH) strategy.

## As an example we’ll use the connecting sSTRK with npeETH strategy

Our [npeETH strategy](https://docs.nimbora.io/docs/concepts/products/earn/pendle_lp_integration/npeETH) is designed to maximize your returns. By participating in this strategy, you not only earn additional yield, but also farm 3x Etherfi points, 1x EigenLayer points, and 1x Nimbora points. This multifaceted reward system ensures that your investments are continuously working hard for you, providing both immediate and long-term benefits.

![npeETH Strategy](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/npeeth.png)


In this scenario, you would be earning yields from both the sSTRK vault and npeETH strategy, as well as 3x Etherfi points, 3x Nimbora points and 1x EigenLayer points.

## TL;DR of the Upgraded sSTRK Vault

1.	**Enhanced Yield**: By leveraging your sSTRK to borrow ETH and invest in high-yield strategies, you can significantly increase your returns.

2.	**Extra Points**: Farm additional points provided by our strategies.

3.	**Seamless Integration**: Enjoy the simplicity we offer. We handle upgrades in the background, manage multiple strategies, and ensure your STRK is always working to its fullest potential.

## Get Started!

To get involved with sSTRK vault, simply follow these steps:

Visit Nimbora dApp via invite link and connect your Starknet wallet ([Braavos](https://braavos.app/) or [ArgentX](https://argent.xyz/)).

![sSTRK Vault](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/vault.png)

Enter the amount of STRK  you want to deposit, or click on the small buttons below the box (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) to set a desired percentage of the balance you want to deposit.

Once the transaction has been accepted on the network, a popup will appear at the bottom left of the screen to let you know.
![sSTRK Deposit Approve ](../../../../static/content/stategy_sstrk/deposit_approved.png)


As a result, you will receive sSTRK, which is Liquid Restaking Token (LRT). And that's it, you should be able to see your balance of Nimbora Yield Token in the portfolio section or directly into your wallet browser. 

## How to request a withdrawal

Withdrawal are not synchronous such as deposits.  Withdrawals take between 12 and 48 hours to be processed. A fast withdrawal option should arrive later on. 


First, you need to decide on the amount you want to withdraw. This could be all or a portion of your assets.
