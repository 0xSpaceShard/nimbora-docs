## Your Earning Starts Immediately!

Your yield comes from several sources -  **nstUSD  base yield** + **$STRK** **incentives** + **Nimbora** **boost.**

**Here's an APR breakdown of the nstUSD strategy**

![alt](../../../../static/content/strategy_nstusd/main.png)

1. **Base**: Represents default strategy yield that auto-compounds daily. 
2. **Boost**: Represents incentives provided by the Nimbora team using the [Starknet Catalyst grant](https://medium.com/@Nimbora/nimbora-and-starknet-catalyst-program-14cc7f2f1ab5) that are claimable every week at the [rewards page](https://app.nimbora.io/rewards/).
3. **Incentives**: Represents incentives provided by the Starknet Foundation as a part of the [DeFi Spring 2.0](https://medium.com/@Nimbora/introducing-defi-spring-2-0-bigger-bolder-better-364bb96b02d6) that are claimable every week at the [rewards page](https://app.nimbora.io/rewards/).
4. **Ekubo LP** Providing Nimbora yield bearing tokens as liquidity on Ekubo is tracked and added to the total claimable STRK amount at the [rewards page](https://app.nimbora.io/rewards/).

## How to request a withdrawal
You can choose between two withdrawal options - Instant and Normal.

Instant withdrawals factor in the price impact and set slippage.

Normal withdrawals are not synchronous such as deposits and take between 12 and 48 hours to be processed.

Once you have selected the withdraw tab, you will need to decide on the amount you want to withdraw. This could be all or a portion of your assets.

Click on the 'withdraw' button and follow the prompts on your wallet ([Braavos](https://braavos.app/) or [ArgentX](https://argent.xyz/)) to complete the transaction.

![alt](../../../../static/content/strategy_nstusd/withdraw_confirm.png)

Once the transaction has been accepted on the network, a popup will appear at the bottom right of the screen to let you know. 

![alt](../../../../static/content/strategy_nstusd/withdraw_accept.png)

You can consult all of your recent transactions in the wallet section. Your transaction should be here. 

![alt](../../../../static/content/strategy_nstusd/recent.png)

And that's it, you should see your pending request in the navbar.

Nimbora takes over the task of processing this request. This involves preparing your assets in order to be transferred back to your wallet, a process that is handled entirely behind the scenes to ensure a smooth and efficient operation. Once the request is ready to be claimed, Nimbora relayer will handle it and send it directly into your wallet.
