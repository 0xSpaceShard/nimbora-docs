# Architecture Overview


## Problem

Users want to interact with DEFI protocols to earn yield and increase their portfolio. Ethereum Mainnet is the most secure and one of the web3 chains that contain the biggest number of DEFI protocols and bigger liquidity in the ecosystem. A famous chain means lots of users, which means higher gas fees. Interacting with a DEFI protocol becomes expensive as the gas unit required to do a simple stake, swap, or withdraw can cost $$ or $$$ depending on the gas price.

## Solution

Nimbora Sync Yield allows users to access L1 yields from L2 without delay, additional gas fees, and liquidity requirements. This is made possible by emitting a share token representing a layer one yield token. Share price is updated at each report, which informs L2 of the yield generated by the L1 strategy.
