# Architecture Overview


## Problem

Users want to interact with DEFI protocols to earn yield and increase their portfolio. Ethereum Mainnet is the most secure and one of the web3 chains that contain the biggest number of DEFI protocols and bigger liquidity in the ecosystem. A famous chain means lots of users, which means higher gas fees. Interacting with a DEFI protocol becomes expensive as the gas unit required to do a simple stake, swap, or withdraw can cost $$ or $$$ depending on the gas price.

## Solution

Nimbora Sync Yield allows users to access L1 yields from L2 without delay, additional gas fees, and liquidity requirements. This is made possible by emitting a share token representing a layer one yield token. Share price is updated at each report, which informs L2 of the yield generated by the L1 strategy.

## L2 Contracts

### Pooling Manager

The pooling manager plays an intermediate role with L2 strategies and L1 communication. The idea is to significantly reduce gas costs on L1 by hashing all of the data and mutualizing bridge transfer. He is also responsible for registering all available strategies and is the only one able to process reports. although he is processing all at once, he is also able to process only one report individually so a broken strategy has no impact on others.

### Pooling Factory

The pooling factory is the contract used to deploy new “strategy packages”: token, and token manager, those contracts are the same for any strategy.

### N-yield Token Manager

The token manager contains all the logic for token accountability through a strategy report, setting the share price at each epoch. It is also the entry point for deposit and withdraw, only this contract can mint or burn tokens.

### N-yield Token

The Nimbora yield token represents the l1 strategy yield-bearing token, increasing in value at each epoch. Once minted, it can be used in DeFi through the Starknet ecosystem.

## L1 Contracts

### Pooling Manager

The pooling manager plays an intermediate role with L1 strategies and L2 communication. The contract receives a payload of data, containing all the information required to cover L2 strategy requests: deposit more in a strategy, inform the underlying NAV, or withdraw some assets.

### Strategy handler

The strategy handler is an adapter used to interact with strategies, it receives data of payload similar for each handler and processes the request before returning the new NAV of the strategy and potentially some ETH to bridge.

Nimbora Yield DEX off-chain services allow for the indexing and processing L1 and L2 reports. For more details, please check this link.
