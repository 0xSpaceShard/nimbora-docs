# Nimbora SDK

## About us

Nimbora is a 1-click DeFi pooling product, incubated by the SpaceShard team. It is a platform that offers you the opportunity to interact with your favorite Layer 1 (L1) protocols at a fraction of the cost of Layer 2 (L2) solutions. The idea behind it is scaling L1 DeFi via L2 execution seamlessly while super-low fees. The technology behind Nimbora is Zero-Knowledge Rollups, currently Starknet - a permissionless decentralized ZK-Rollup that operates as an L2 network over Ethereum.  To put it simply, Nimbora scales L1 DeFi products completely trustlessly using rollups. 

You can learn more about Nimbora by following us on [Medium](https://medium.com/@Nimbora), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nimbora_io), or by joining our [Discord group](https://discord.gg/feJJnkmYzc).
