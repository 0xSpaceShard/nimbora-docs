Nimbora","description":"Nimbora stands out in the blockchain space primarily due to its innovative approach to minimizing transaction costs for its users. The platform achieves this remarkable feat by leveraging the power of Layer 2 (L2) solutions, specifically Starknet, to offer gas fees that are up to seven times lower than those on the Ethereum mainnet. This significant cost reduction opens up new possibilities for users, making decentralized finance (DeFi) interactions more accessible and economical.","sidebar":"strategiesSidebar"},"concepts/overview":{"id":"concepts/overview","title":"About Nimbora","description":"Nimbora is a Starknet-based cross-chain yield strategy platform that enables users to engage with Layer 1 protocols at a fraction of the cost. Powered by the innovative minds at the SpaceShard team, we leverage Starknet\'s Zero-Knowledge Rollups to provide cost-effective DeFi strategies without compromising security or trust.","sidebar":"strategiesSidebar"},"concepts/risks/liquity_lsud":{"id":"concepts/risks/liquity_lsud","title":"LUSD strategy","description":"Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows users to take out loans against Ethereum collateral without paying interest. These loans are paid out in LUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the USD. While our previous guide covered the basic risks associated with using Liquity, this expanded guide incorporates insights from recent discussions about price stability and addresses concerns within the Liquity ecosystem.","sidebar":"strategiesSidebar"},"concepts/risks/starknet":{"id":"concepts/risks/starknet","title":"Starknet","description":"Starknet, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offers significant benefits in terms of transaction speed and cost. However, like any technology, it comes with its own set of risks. Here, we break down some of these risks in simple terms.","sidebar":"strategiesSidebar"},"concepts/strategies/liquity":{"id":"concepts/strategies/liquity","title":"Liquity Strategy","description":"Liquity strategy allows users to borrow LUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, using ETH as collateral. This strategy is beneficial for users who want to leverage their assets without selling them.  If ETH value goes up while the loan is active, repaying it becomes more profitable as users get back their ETH, now more valuable. On top of this, participating in this strategy now comes with a bonus: a ~45% APR in STRK tokens, paid out every two weeks, thanks to the DeFi Spring initiative.","sidebar":"strategiesSidebar"},"contracts/architecture/l1_arch":{"id":"contracts/architecture/l1_arch","title":"L1 Architecture","description":"L1 Contracts","sidebar":"contractsSidebar"},"contracts/architecture/l2_arch":{"id":"contracts/architecture/l2_arch","title":"L2 Architecture","description":"L2 Contracts","sidebar":"contractsSidebar"},"contracts/architecture/overview":{"id":"contracts/architecture/overview","title":"Overview","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"contractsSidebar"},"contracts/deployed/mainnet_contracts":{"id":"contracts/deployed/mainnet_contracts","title":"Mainnet","description":"L1 Mainnet contracts","sidebar":"contractsSidebar"},"contracts/deployed/testnet_contracts":{"id":"contracts/deployed/testnet_contracts","title":"Testnet","description":"L1 Sepolia Contracts","sidebar":"contractsSidebar"},"contracts/guides/create_strategy":{"id":"contracts/guides/create_strategy","title":"How to create new strategies","description":"This guide will walk you through the process of deploying a new strategy and interacting with it.","sidebar":"contractsSidebar"},"contracts/guides/epoch":{"id":"contracts/guides/epoch","title":"Epoch","description":"On Nimbora, keeping track of each processed batch is crucial.
